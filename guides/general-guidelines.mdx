Before integrating with the Blaaiz Platform API, review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and reliable development experience.

## Using the Blaaiz Platform API

### Authentication

- All requests to the Blaaiz API must be authenticated using a valid API key.
- You can generate and manage your API keys from the Blaaiz Dashboard.
- Include your API key in every request.
- Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.

### Rate Limits & Usage

- To ensure fair usage and maintain platform stability, the Blaaiz API enforces rate and usage limits.
- Requests exceeding these limits may be throttled or temporarily blocked.
- If you anticipate high request volumes, contact Blaaiz [support](mailto:support@blaaiz.com) to discuss your use case.

### Response Format

- All API responses are returned in JSON format.
- Successful responses include the requested data.
- Error responses include a descriptive `message` field to help you understand and resolve the issue.

**Example error response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### Best Practices

- Handle errors gracefully by checking HTTP status codes and error messages.
- Log API responses during development to aid debugging.
- Always test integrations in a safe environment before going live.
