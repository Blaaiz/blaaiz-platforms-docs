title: CAD
description: Webhook payload for CAD collection transactions
---

<Warning>
You must have added an interac email (e.g payments@company.com) via the Blaaiz dashboard. Without this, funds won't reflect in your wallet.
</Warning>

When your CAD wallet is funded via Interac's auto-deposit, details about the transaction are sent in a payload that provides essential information for record-keeping and reconciliation.

These are sent to your `collection_url` when your business receives funds.
