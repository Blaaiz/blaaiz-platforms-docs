description: Understanding collections and how to attach customers to transactions
---

Collections are slightly different as they can be triggered by external sources, such as payments through Interac for Canadian Dollars (CAD) or virtual accounts for Nigerian Naira (NGN).

After receiving a confirmed transaction via webhook, you can attach a customer to the collection using the following steps.

<Note>
For CAD collections, you must have added an Interac email (e.g. `support@blaaiz.com`) via the Blaaiz dashboard. Without this, funds will not reflect in your wallet.
</Note>

## Attach a customer to the collection

Once a collection transaction is confirmed, you'll need to associate it with a customer.

- **Endpoint**: `/collection`
- **Request**: Provide the `customer_id` and `transaction_id` to associate a customer with the collection transaction.
- **Purpose**: This allows the transaction to be linked with a customer, ensuring the proper attribution of funds.

## Fees breakdown endpoint

The request payload allows you to initiate a transfer between two currencies. The `from_currency_id` represents the originating currency, and `to_currency_id` represents the currency the recipient will receive. In cases where you're sending the same currency (e.g. NGN to NGN), both `from_currency_id` and `to_currency_id` should be set to `NGN`.

- `from_amount`: The amount you want to send from your wallet.
- `to_amount`: Used when you want the recipient to receive an **exact amount**, regardless of fees.

### Example

If you want to send **₦500** from your wallet, set the `from_amount` to `500`. The system will calculate the total amount to deduct from your balance, including any fees. If you set the `to_amount` instead, the system calculates how much to deduct so the recipient receives the exact amount you specified **after** fees.

## Response details

The response provides detailed information about how the transaction will be processed.

- **Payout Method**: You can choose a method, such as `BANK_TRANSFER` for NGN or `INTERAC` for CAD.
- **payout_fees Section**:
  - `recipient_gets`: The final amount the recipient will receive after all fees.
  - `total_fees`: The total applicable fees (platform + method-specific).

### Fee breakdown terms

- `you_send`: Total amount deducted from your wallet (includes transaction fees).
- `total_amount_to_send`: The amount you're sending to the recipient.
- `recipient_gets`: Final amount the recipient receives after fees.

For **same-currency transactions** (e.g. NGN → NGN):

- If no fees apply: `you_send`, `total_amount_to_send`, and `recipient_gets` will be the same.
- If fees apply: `you_send` will differ, while `total_amount_to_send` and `recipient_gets` remain the same.

For **multi-currency transactions** (e.g. CAD → NGN):

- Values will differ based on the exchange rate.
- `you_send` will reflect the amount in CAD.
- `recipient_gets` will reflect the Naira equivalent.
- The exchange rate used is included in the response for transparency.

This response helps you understand the costs associated with each transaction method and gives you control over how much you send or how much the recipient receives.
