## Guidelines for using the Blaaiz API

- A **valid API key** is required to authenticate all requests to the API endpoints. You can obtain your API key from your [Blaaiz Dashboard](https://business.blaaiz.com).
- The API is subject to [rate and usage limits](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/) to ensure fair usage and maintain system stability.
- All API responses are returned in **JSON format**. In the event of an error, the response body will include a `message` key containing a description of the issue.
