title: IP whitelisting
description: Learn how to whitelist your IP addresses for API access
---

Blaaiz requires merchants to submit their IP addresses for whitelisting as part of the onboarding process. API calls from non-whitelisted IP addresses will be rejected.

## Why IP whitelisting?

IP whitelisting adds an extra layer of security to your API integration by ensuring that only requests from your approved IP addresses can access the Blaaiz Platform API. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access.

## How to submit your IP addresses

During the onboarding process, you must provide the IP addresses that will be used to make API calls. To submit your IP addresses:

1. Identify all IP addresses that will be used to make API requests (e.g., your server IPs, development environment IPs)
2. Contact [support@blaaiz.com](mailto:support@blaaiz.com) with your list of IP addresses
3. Wait for confirmation that your IPs have been whitelisted

<Note>
  If you use dynamic IP addresses or cloud services with changing IPs, contact
  support to discuss alternative solutions.
</Note>

## Adding or updating IP addresses

If you need to add new IP addresses or update existing ones after onboarding:

1. Send a request to [support@blaaiz.com](mailto:support@blaaiz.com) with the IP addresses you want to add or remove
2. Include your business name and account details for verification
3. Allow time for the changes to be processed

<Warning>
  API calls from non-whitelisted IP addresses will be rejected with an
  authentication error. Ensure all your production and development IPs are
  whitelisted before going live.
</Warning>

## Best practices

- Keep a record of all whitelisted IP addresses for your organization
- Notify Blaaiz support before migrating to new servers or infrastructure
- Use static IP addresses where possible for production environments
- Test API connectivity after any IP changes
