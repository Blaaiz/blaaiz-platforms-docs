description: Understand API rate limits and usage restrictions
---

All endpoints are rate limited to **100 requests per minute**. If you exceed this limit, the API will return an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

To help you monitor your usage, each API response includes the following headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests allowed per minute. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time (in UTC epoch seconds) when the current rate limit window resets. |
