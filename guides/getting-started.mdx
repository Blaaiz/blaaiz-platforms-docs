## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Blaaiz Platform API, you'll need:

- **A Blaaiz business account** — Sign up at [business registration link](https://business.blaaiz.com).
- **Completed KYB verification** — Your business must pass our Know Your Business (KYB) verification process.
- **API Services enabled** — Request access to API Services through your dedicated account manager or by contacting [support@blaaiz.com](mailto:support@blaaiz.com).
- **Whitelisted IP addresses** — Only approved IPs can call the API.

> **IP whitelisting is required before making API calls.**
>
> Submit the server IPs you will use for API requests. Calls from non-whitelisted IPs are rejected for security.

## Step 1: Request API Access

To start building with the Blaaiz Platform API, API Services must be enabled for your business account.

**How to request access:**

- Navigate to your business dashboard and request API access. <span className="coming-soon">coming soon</span>, **or**
- Contact our team at [support@blaaiz.com](mailto:support@blaaiz.com).

Once your request is approved, API Services will be provisioned for your account and you'll be able to generate API keys.

## Step 2: Generate Your API Key

After API Services are enabled for your account:

1. Log in to your Blaaiz business dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **API Settings** section.
3. Your API key will be automatically generated and displayed.
4. In rare cases where automatic generation doesn't occur, you can manually generate a key with one click.
5. In case of compromise, you can generate new API keys (up to 3), and disable the compromised key.

**Important:** Store your API key securely. It will be used to authenticate all requests to the Blaaiz Platform API.
