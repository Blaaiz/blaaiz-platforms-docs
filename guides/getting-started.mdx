To begin using the Blaaiz RaaS API, you must first have a business account and must have completed KYB. Once your account is set up, you need to request access to our API services. After your request is received, access will be provisioned internally.

## Step 1 - Request API access

To start interacting with our system via the API, you need to be enabled for API services. You can reach out to [support@blaaiz.com](mailto:support@blaaiz.com). Once this access has been granted, you'll receive an API key that allows you to authenticate and interact with our services.

## Step 2 - Generate API key

After access has been granted, an API KEY will be generated automatically and that can be gotten from your dashboard. In a very rare case that this is not done automatically, you will create one with just a click right on the dashboard.

The Blaaiz RaaS provides API services that enable you to start receiving and facilitating payments without breaking a sweat.
