Blaaiz RaaS uses API keys for authentication/authorization of all API requests. After generating your API key (as described in the Getting Started section), you must include it in the headers of every API request.

The API key should be included as a header named `x-blaaiz-api-key` in every request you send. Failure to include the API key or using an incorrect one will result in an authentication error.

```json
x-blaaiz-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Authentication errors

Blaaiz RaaS API provides specific error messages for authentication issues:

### 401 Unauthorized

- The API key is missing.
- The API key is malformed or improperly formatted.

<Note>
Ensure that the API key is correctly included in your request headers.
</Note>

### 403 Access Denied

This error occurs in the following cases:

- The API key is valid but its status is inactive.
- Your access to the API services has been disabled by Blaaiz.

<Warning>
Make sure that your API key is active and your account is properly set up for API service access to avoid these errors.
</Warning>
