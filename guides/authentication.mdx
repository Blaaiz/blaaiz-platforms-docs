description: Learn how to authenticate your API requests to the Blaaiz API.

## Overview

The Blaaiz Platform API uses API keys to authenticate and authorize all requests. Every request to the API must include a valid API key in the request headers.

You can generate and manage your API keys from the Blaaiz Dashboard (see Getting Started).

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the request headers. Example (curl):

```bash
curl -X GET https://api-prod.blaaiz.com/api/wallets \
  -H "x-blaaiz-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Important Notes

- The API key must be included with every request.
- API keys are secret credentials. Do not expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
- Requests without a valid API key will fail with an authentication error.

## Authentication errors

Blaaiz Platform API provides specific error messages for authentication issues:

### 401 Unauthorized

- The API key is missing.
- The API key is malformed or improperly formatted.

<Note>
  Ensure that the API key is correctly included in your request headers.
</Note>

### 403 Access Denied

This error occurs in the following cases:

- The API key is valid but its status is inactive.
- Your access to the API services has been disabled by Blaaiz.

<Warning>
  Make sure that your API key is active and your account is properly set up for
  API service access to avoid these errors.
</Warning>
