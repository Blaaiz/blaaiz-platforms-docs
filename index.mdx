## Setting up

To begin using the Blaaiz RaaS API, you must first have a [<u>business</u>](https://business.blaaiz.com/) account and must have completed the KYB process. Once your account is set up, you need to request access to our API services. After your request is received, access will be provisioned internally.

1. **Request API Access** 

   To start interacting with our system via the API, you need to be enabled for API services. You can reach out to [<u>onboarding@blaaiz.com</u>](mailto:onboarding@blaaiz.com). Once this access has been granted, you'll receive an API key that allows you to authenticate and interact with our services.
2. **Getting your API Key**\
   To do this, simply tap on your role and name section (or the caret beside your name at the top right of the home screen), then select the API & Webhooks option.
