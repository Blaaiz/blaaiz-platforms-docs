## When do we need to use payment links in the collection process?

Payment links are used for collection methods that require customer interaction:

- NGN card collections
- USD collections
- EUR/GBP collections via Open Banking

Push mechanisms like **Interac (CAD)** and **virtual bank accounts (NGN)** do not require payment links.

## How does the payment link flow work?

When you initiate a collection through our API for any of the methods listed above:

1. We return a `payment_url` in the API response.
2. You redirect your customer to this URL to complete the transaction.
3. After completion, the customer's browser will either close or redirect, depending on your configuration.
4. We notify you of the successful payment via webhook.
