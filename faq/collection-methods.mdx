## How do we collect CAD (Canadian Dollars)?

For CAD, we use **Interac**, which is a push mechanism:

- No collection API integration is needed
- We provide you with an Interac email address
- You share this email with your customers
- When they send money via Interac to this email, we'll notify you via webhook
- The webhook contains the sender's email and name for your reference

## How do we collect NGN (Nigerian Naira)?

For NGN, you have two options:

### Bank transfer (push mechanism)

- Create virtual bank accounts for your customers via our API
- Share the virtual account details with your customers
- When money is sent to those accounts, we notify you via webhook
- The funds automatically update your NGN wallet balance

### Card payment (pull mechanism)

- Call our collection API to initiate the transaction
- We'll provide a payment link for your customer
- Customer completes the card payment via the link
- We'll notify you when the payment is complete

## How do we collect USD?

For USD, here's how it works:

**Virtual account creation:**

- Generate a USD virtual account for your customer via our API.
- We'll verify the customer's KYC details first.
- We'll notify you via webhook once the account details are ready.

**Receiving payments:**

- Share the virtual account details with your customer.
- They can send USD from any bank that supports international transfers.
- We'll notify you via webhook when funds arrive.

## How does EUR/GBP collection via Open Banking work?

Open Banking is a **pull mechanism**:

- You initiate the transaction via our collection API
- We provide a URL for the customer to complete authentication with their bank
- The customer completes the transaction
- We notify you when the payment is successful

## How do you identify users when collecting CAD via Interac?

Interac funding works via a **push mechanism**, meaning transactions are initiated from the sender's bank. We do not control or initiate the transaction from our end, so there's no pre-creation of transactions or reference passing on Interac itself.

That said, there are two effective ways to identify which incoming Interac payment belongs to which user or transaction:

### 1. Interac email mapping (recommended)

Introduce a feature that lets users register Interac email addresses within your platform (either one or multiple). When a webhook is sent for an incoming Interac payment, it includes a `collection_email`. You can then match this email against your internal records (e.g. a `user_interac_emails` table) to determine the rightful owner of the funds.

### 2. Enforce email matching

Require your users to sign up using the same email address they use to send funds via Interac. When we send you a webhook, you'll receive a `collection_email`, and you can match it directly to the user account in your system.

<Note>
The `collection_email` is the email address of the sender.
