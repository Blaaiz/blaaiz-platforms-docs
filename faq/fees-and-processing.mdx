## How do we calculate transaction fees?

Use our **Fees API** endpoint, which provides a complete breakdown of fees for both collections and payouts across all methods and currencies.

This will help you determine the total amount to collect from customers.

## For the Collection API, does the amount include fees?

Yes, the `amount` parameter should include the **total you wish to collect** from the customer, including any applicable fees.
