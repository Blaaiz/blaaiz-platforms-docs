## What are the required parameters for the collection API?

The collection API requires the following parameters:

- `method` - The collection method (e.g., `"card"`, `"bank_transfer"`)
- `amount` - The total amount including all applicable fees
- `customer_id` - The unique identifier created via the Customer API
- `wallet_id` - Your business wallet ID for the specific currency
- `phone_number` - Required for certain collection methods

Always consult the API documentation for the specific requirements of each collection method, as they may vary.

## Do we need to implement all collection methods?

No, you only need to implement the collection methods that correspond to your supported currencies.

For example:

- If your business only handles CAD and NGN transactions, you don't need to implement the Open Banking flow used for EUR/GBP transactions
- You can choose to implement only the specific collection methods that align with your business needs and supported currencies

## What is IP whitelisting and why is it required?

IP whitelisting is a security requirement where merchants must submit their server IP addresses during onboarding. Only API requests from whitelisted IP addresses will be accepted—requests from non-whitelisted IPs will be rejected.

To whitelist your IP addresses:

1. Identify all IP addresses that will make API calls
2. Submit them to [support@blaaiz.com](mailto:support@blaaiz.com) during onboarding
3. Contact support if you need to add or update IPs after onboarding

For more details, see the [IP whitelisting guide](/guides/ip-whitelisting).
