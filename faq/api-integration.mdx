## What are the required parameters for the collection API?

The collection API requires the following parameters:

- `method` - The collection method (e.g., `"card"`, `"bank_transfer"`)
- `amount` - The total amount including all applicable fees
- `customer_id` - The unique identifier created via the Customer API
- `wallet_id` - Your business wallet ID for the specific currency
- `phone_number` - Required for certain collection methods

Always consult the API documentation for the specific requirements of each collection method, as they may vary.

## Do we need to implement all collection methods?

No, you only need to implement the collection methods that correspond to your supported currencies.

For example:

- If your business only handles CAD and NGN transactions, you don't need to implement the Open Banking flow used for EUR/GBP transactions
- You can choose to implement only the specific collection methods that align with your business needs and supported currencies
