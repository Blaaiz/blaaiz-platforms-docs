## How will we know when a payment is received?

We'll notify you via **webhooks** for all successful collections, regardless of the method used — Interac, bank transfer, card payment, or Open Banking.

We'll also notify you when a transaction (payout) is initiated. This is very useful for CAD payouts where you need the Interac question and answer before the payment is completed.

## What information is included in the webhook?

The webhook payload includes transaction details such as:

- Sender's information (where available)
- Amount
- Transaction reference
- Status
