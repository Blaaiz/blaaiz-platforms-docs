## Do we need to create a virtual bank account for each customer?

This is only required if you want to collect **NGN via bank transfer**.

Each customer would need their own virtual account to ensure proper tracking of payments.

## Can two virtual bank accounts have the same account name?

Yes. What makes a virtual bank account unique is the **account number**, not the name. You can have multiple accounts with the same name but different account numbers.

## How do we create a virtual bank account?

Use our **"Create a Virtual Bank Account"** API endpoint. You will need to provide parameters including the `account_name` and your `wallet_id`. We will return the virtual account details that you can share with your customer.
