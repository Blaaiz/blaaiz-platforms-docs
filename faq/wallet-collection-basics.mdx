## How many wallets do we need to set up for our business?

Your business will have **one wallet per currency** (e.g. one CAD wallet, one NGN wallet, one USD wallet). Multiple collections from different customers will all update the same business wallet for that currency.

## What's the difference between a wallet and a virtual bank account?

A **wallet** stores your balance for a specific currency on our platform. A **virtual bank account** is a collection method that's linked to your NGN wallet. You can create multiple virtual accounts, all tied to the same wallet.

## How does the wallet ID parameter work in the Collection API?

The `wallet_id` represents your business wallet for the specific currency you wish to collect. This parameter tells our system which of your business wallets should receive the funds.
